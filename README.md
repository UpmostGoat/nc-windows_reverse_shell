A good question arises: How do I get them to enter the command?

I used a BadUSB

You can find the script [here](https://github.com/UpmostGoat/nc-windows_reverse_shell/blob/main/payload.dd)

If you don't know about BadUSB's, watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_f9p-_JWZw

If you want a pico, get it from [here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4864).
It takes a little longer, but the price is much better than Amazon
